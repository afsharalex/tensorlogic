// ============================================
// Inner Product - Orthogonality Example
// ============================================
// Two vectors are orthogonal if their dot product is zero

// Vector U: points along x-axis
U = [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]

// Vector V: points along y-axis
V = [0.0, 1.0, 0.0]

// Compute inner product (should be 0 for orthogonal vectors)
orthogonal_check = U[i] V[i]

orthogonal_check?  // Expected: 0.0
